# Welcome
We are thrilled that you have shown interest in the MAGIST project. We are currently in the process of building the 
MAGIST. As a result, there might be issues or bugs that you encounter. If you encounter any issues, please post a issue 
on the MAGIST Github repository. We will try to resolve them as soon as possible. If you have a solution to the issue, 
you may create a pull request and we will review it as soon as possible. With that out of the way, let's get started!

## How it works?
We are using a powerful technique that combine the decades of research brilliant researchers have done. We are using a 
multi-agent approach to intelligently process real-world data and learn off of it. To understand this, however, it is 
crucial to understand how we define general intelligence, as there are major discrepancies from source to source. 

### Our Goal
General intelligence is the ability of a machine to automatically acquire and train itself on a vast variety of knowledge that it may acquire from any source. It must also be able to make new predictions on the data upon inquisition (direct or indirect). This machine may not start with any pre-trained models, data, etc.

## Setup
MAGIST is a complex project, so a clean and efficient work space is essential. The entirety of this project was made in 
the following environment:
 * PyCharm Professional
 * Python 3.10.4
 * Anaconda Environment (https://www.anaconda.com/)
 * Firefox Headless (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/headless/)

Replicating this environment is crucial for stability and performance.
