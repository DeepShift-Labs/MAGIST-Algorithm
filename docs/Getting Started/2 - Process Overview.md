# Process Overview

Understanding the core fundamentals of MAGIST is crucial for designing a custom process pipeline using the powerful features the MAGIST API exposes.

## Current System Diagram

This is the exact process running the current MAGIST process pipeline. There are hundreds of features left to implement.

**Note: We do NOT claim that this current process is MAGIST's final form OR that this current process is Generally Intelligent. With proper language processors, transformers, MDCs, etc., it has the potential of being the WORLD's first AGI(Artificial General Intelligence).**

## How can this be an AGI?

Human brains, or any animal brain, processes information in logical, discrete steps. It takes the data, runs some pre-processing, and then computes an environment. This is our perception of reality. In fact, if humans believe hard enough, it is possible to influence this computation and see a different reality.

With MAGIST, I have took a similar approach. The data is processed, in turn, slowly extracting meaning from it. This contradicts with most modern powerful AI models who use a single, massive network. Some examples include: GPT-3, BERT, Imagen, etc. This limits the functionality of the AI, in terms of AGIs, since human-procured data has to be fed to it. This data is sorted and assesed with a fine-toothed comb and removes the stochasity the environment contains. This also reduces its ability to teach itself new tasks. Despite being multi-functionaly, it is functionaly limited.

That is why MAGIST uses a multi-agent, self-supervised approach. This will allow it to teach itself a lot of new things simply by following the outlined pipeline. Although MAGIST is currently limited in the types of data it can process and predict upon, it can evolve to be incredibly intelligent.
