# TensorFlow Official Models

The TensorFlow official models are a collection of models
that use TensorFlowâ€™s high-level APIs.
They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date
with the latest TensorFlow API.

They should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still
being easy to read.
These models are used as end-to-end tests, ensuring that the models run
with the same or improved speed and performance with each new TensorFlow build.

## More models to come!

The team is actively developing new models.
In the near future, we will add:

* State-of-the-art language understanding models.
* State-of-the-art image classification models.
* State-of-the-art object detection and instance segmentation models.
* State-of-the-art video classification models.

## How to get started with the official models

*   The official models in the master branch are developed using
[master branch of TensorFlow 2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master).
When you clone (the repository) or download (`pip` binary) master branch of
official models , master branch of TensorFlow gets downloaded as a
dependency. This is equivalent to the following.

```shell
pip3 install tf-models-nightly
pip3 install tensorflow-text-nightly # when model uses `nlp` packages
```

*   Incase of stable versions, targeting a specific release, Tensorflow-models
repository version numbers match with the target TensorFlow release. For
example, [TensorFlow-models v2.5.0]
(https://github.com/tensorflow/models/releases/tag/v2.5.0)
is compatible with [TensorFlow v2.5.0]
(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.5.0).
This is equivalent to the following.

```shell
pip3 install tf-models-official==2.5.0
pip3 install tensorflow-text==2.5.0 # when model uses `nlp` packages
```

Please follow the below steps before running models in this repository.

### Requirements

* The latest TensorFlow Model Garden release and the latest TensorFlow 2
  * If you are on a version of TensorFlow earlier than 2.2, please
upgrade your TensorFlow to [the latest TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).
* Python 3.7+

Our integration tests run with Python 3.7. Although Python 3.6 should work, we
don't recommend earlier versions.
